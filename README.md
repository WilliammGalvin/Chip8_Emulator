# Chip-8 Emulator
## Overview
This is a Chip-8 Emulator built in C++ using SFML. The project is designed to emulate the Chip-8 virtual machine and run Chip-8 programs (usually .ch8 or .rom files). It includes a built-in console for debugging, an executed opcode history, and a real-time register display to facilitate a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the Chip-8 system.

## Key Features
- Chip-8 Emulation: Accurately emulates the Chip-8 system with support for various instructions.
- Console for Debugging: Includes a console window that logs debugging information, such as opcode execution details, errors, and other runtime information.
- Opcode History: Keeps track of all executed opcodes during the emulation for reference and debugging.
- Register Information: Displays the state of the Chip-8 registers in real-time, giving insight into the machineâ€™s operation during execution.
- SFML Graphics: Uses SFML for graphical rendering and event handling, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
